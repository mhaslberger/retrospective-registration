26812052,"The trial was registered on February 18th, 2011 i.e. after enrollment has begun (FPFV 06/2007). At the time when the trial was started, the initiators of this study were unfortunately unaware of the policy of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which requires prospective registration of all interventional clinical trials. As soon as we became aware of this policy, we registered the trial. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered."
26305790,"The principal investigator (N.H.) delayed the registration of the study until data acquisition was completed for confidentiality reasons concerning the study methods, especially the magnetic resonance with the related morphometric measurements [38]. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered."
25768735,"This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) underðNCT02056951ðafter enrolment of participants started. This study was planned in 2006 and received a public funding from the German pension insurance in 2007. A trial registration was not required by the German pension insurance or the independent research ethics committee of the Medical Faculty at Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nðrnberg. The public awareness, that the registration of all studies meeting the WHO definition of a clinical trial should be considered as a scientific, ethical and moral responsibility (http://www.who.int/ictrp/faq/en/), has increased in Germany during the last years. However, during the planning period of this trial (2006ð2007) the registration of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions with a primary educational focus within the German rehabilitation setting was not a necessary and well-established procedure in Germany. Since 2010 all interventional studies of our working group are registered in the trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, the authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered."
25884637,"At the time of submission of the study protocol, the Ethics Committee did not require registration for feasibility or proof of concept studies. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02196545) in July 2014 in preparation of a manuscript for publication of the data. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.ð"
27467683,"Initially the authors did not register the trial because the used toothpastes were cosmetics and no drugs; however, the trial was registered subsequently atðwww.clinicaltrials.gov(ClinicalTrials.govðNCT 02697539)."
28033320,The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration numberðNCT02920164) after the enrollment of the participants was started since initially the authors regarded the project as an experimental investigation. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.ð
28323838,The ACTION-HD trial was registered at the EudraCT clinical trial register (EudraCT number 2009-013698-16) on 24thðMarch 2011 prior to inclusion of the first patient. We later registered the trial at clinicaltrials.gov. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.
31465443,"The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberÊNCT01330485. Because of administrative problems, release of registration occurred about six months after study start. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Relevant de-identified data can be downloaded fromÊhttps://osf.io/426pd."
30011285,"The full study protocol was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (numberÊNCT02661607) in June 2015. The reason for retrospectively registering the study was that the study authors were not aware of the recommendation to register diagnostic accuracy studies before this date. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. The first patient was included on November 10th, 2014, the last patient was included on April 5th, 2016."
32853281,"was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration numberðNCT03093584). This registration was performed later than the enrolment of the participants was started, since initially the authors regarded the project as an experimental investigation. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for auricular stimulation for anxiety are registered at clinicaltrials.gov.ð"
27861546,It did not fall under the regulations of either the legal requirements for testing medical devices nor under the legal requirements for testing medications and thus a registration in a clinical trials registry was not mandatory prior to recruitment of patients (S1 Checklist). Due to this reason and because of funding issues the study was launched as early as possible. After translation of the CRF and all protocols into English (S1ðandðS2Protocols) it was registered belated at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02670265). Currently there are no ongoing and related trials for this intervention study.
29077724,"Due to organisational changes in the research project shortly before the start of the recruitment we put great efforts into avoiding a delayed start of the data collection in the cooperating inpatient units, which resulted in retrospective study registration and a delayed publication of our study protocol. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered."
26735993,"The study started recruitment in October 2006. At the time, there was confusion among European investigators regarding the need to register the trial before initiation of enrollment; the trial was registered in May 2008."
29258499,"Given the amount of paperwork, approvalsð and signatures that were needed from university administration, hospital management, faculty members, or participating team members through the different stages of the study, following a strict time plan was not always possible. Consequently, the delays in all study phases led to a 2-week overlap of the study period with the month of Ramadan, which forced us to start our final interviews 2ðweeks ahead of schedule. Though this might not have had a noticeable impact on our results, it could still be seen as a limitation of our study.ð"
30026282,"This trial is registered withÊhttp://www.ClinicalTrials.govÊ(NCT01890317). The time of first registration was June 17, 2013, and final approved trial registration was July 1, 2013. First patient inclusion was in July 2012Êat the Heart Center LeipzigÐUniversity Hospital, Leipzig, Germany. Thus, there was a delay between first patient inclusion and trial registration that was the result of a misunderstanding betweenÊthe principalÊinvestigator of the trial, Dr Thiele, and the first author, Dr Fuernau, who was responsibleÊfor clinical project coordination at the investigatorÕs site at the Heart Center LeipzigÐUniversity of Leipzig. According to initial communication, registration had to be performed by Dr Fuernau. When the study principal investigator recognized that it had not been performed, we immediately registered the trial atÊhttp://www.ClinicalTrials.gov. At this time, only 7 patients at the Heart Center LeipzigÐUniversity Hospital had been included in the trial."
23730377,"It was not registered at a clinical trial register, because at the time of setup in 2003, such a registration was not obligatory."
26501562,The study was registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:ðNCT02253563). Registration of the trial was delayed after the enrollment of the first patient due to an administrative error. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.
29083953,"The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 4 months after enrollment of the first patient, as discussed in theÊSupplementary Appendix /É/ Thus, there was a delay of trial registration before first patient inclusion which was induced by a misunderstanding between the project coordination for the EU grant (at this time gabo:mi, later on ARTTIC) and the clinical project coordination at the investigator's site at the Heart Center Leipzig - University of Leipzig. According to initial communication registration should be performed by gabo:mi. When the study coordinator recognized that it has not been performed we immediately registered it at clinicaltrials.gov. At this time only 13 patients at the Heart Center Leipzig Ð University Hospital (and no other study site) have been included into the trial."

Registration of the study was applied for in April 2015. All queries from the DRKS were answered until the 31stðAugust 2015 except the planned inclusion date of the first patient (first-patient-in), which was correct in the DRKS registry on 1stðDecember 2015.
